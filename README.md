# Abstract #

CDISC 360i defines a vision and roadmap to enable standards-driven automation across the clinical research data life cycle - from study design to analysis. The purpose of these notebooks is to demonstrate the 360i Technical Roadmap by showcasing a strategy for research data pipeline automation using end-to-end, machine-readable standards metadata.

These notebooks automate study design using concepts and a standardized model to build a digital protocol. Aligned Case Report Forms (CRFs) and SDTM resources will be automatically generated as downstream artifacts using metadata from the digital protocol.

# Notebooks #
## Dockerized Notebook

This environment exists as two Docker containers; one hosting a PostgreSQL relational database and the other, the Jupyter notebook environment.

### How-to

1. Clone the repository 
2. Change into the root of the cloned directory.
3. In the root of the cloned repository, create a .env text file.
4. Enter the following in .env:

    ![Example .env file configuration with environment variables](images/image.png)

5. Enter custom values for the environmental variables and save the file changes.
6. Execute `source initial-startup.sh`
7. Open a browser to http://localhost:8888
8. Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the *CDISC_360i_Jupyter_Protocol_to_Submission.ipynb* notebook.

All CDISC utilities as well as the resources will be created in the notebooks directory in the *clinical-notebook* container.

All tables will be created in the PostgreSQL database in the *clinical-database* container.

## Google Colab Notebooks
Currently, these notebooks are designed to execute in the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google.com/) environment.

|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|CDISC_360i_Object_Store_Automation         |* Does not copy study artifacts to local filesystem, but works entirely with objects in Object Store    |
|                                           |* Uses Google Drive as Object Store                                |
|                                           |* Requires Colab env setup for Google Drive                        |
|                                           |* Development will continue as new tools and features become available |
|CDISC_360i_Protocol_to_Submission (deprecated)         |* Shown at CDISC Interchange                                       |
|                                           |* Copies study artifacts to local filesystem prior to copying to Object Store  |
|                                           |* Uses Google Drive as Object Store                                |
|                                           |* Requires Colab env setup for Google Drive                        |
|                                           |* Development has stopped for this version                         |

## How To ##

1. Login to your Google Colab environment
2. Copy the *CDISC_360i_Object_Store_Automation.ipynb* notebook into the environment.

**Notes:**
1. The notebook relies upon access to your Google Drive.
2. If you would like to access the OpenStudyBuilder API, you must supply a BEARER_TOKEN.
3. The *core.tar.gz* used in the notebook is a distribution of the CORE engine built for the Google Colab environment as of October 2025.  Google Colab environment future updates may require the creation of a new distribution of the CORE engine (links are included in the notebook).
